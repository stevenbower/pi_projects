# Elijah's Costume 2017

This code drives the holloween costume I made for my son Elijah for Halloween 2017. It is uses a set of shift registers to drive 16 LEDs and a 4x4 Membrane Keypad to switch effects on the lights. The are mounted into a aluminium foil coated cardboard box with head/arm holes cut-out. Along with the 16 (8 Red + 8 Green) LEDs there is a set of 30 Blue LEDs connected to a battery pack that act as backup lights if the Pi fails, batteries run out, etc..
